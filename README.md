My interest in coding started when I was 11. A friend of mine showed me the naughty possibilities of Batch scrips and that was the beginning of _my_ rabbit hole.

Then ensued my introduction to: Visual Basic, Java (LeJOS NXJ), JavaScript, Objective-C, Python, e.g.

I'm a fast learner and good at grasping new concepts. That learning has been led by my interests, which has in practice given me a broad knowledge. My focus has been on creating well-built, useful programs. That has made me a good programmer.

Code is a tool that I use to create systems and installations, and thereby express myself creatively. My passion doesn't lie in code, but one can't master his trade without mastering his tool.

Enjoy.
